The eXokernel Development Kit is an open source effort to build exokernel capabilities for the Linux operating system.

The project uses code developed and released by Samsung Research America.

20-11-2014:

The AHCI test driver now operates without root permissions.  This is
quite a milestone since running device drivers as non-priviledged 
processes is a cornerstone of the exokernel concept.  Root permission
is needed to load the kernel module and also to "grant" permissions
to a user (uid) for a specific device. See tools/devgrant/

12-11-2014:  

XDK seed code released as open source.  At this point much of
the code is not fully operational and requires significant attention.  The
basic Exokernel is operational and the AHCI block device driver can be 
used to demonstrate its capability.
